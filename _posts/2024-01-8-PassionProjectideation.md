## Casino Simulator

We want to begin with a login page, prompting the user to create an account with a username and password. Once the account is created, we move the user to the casino home page, where we give the user $100 in game currency and the user can choose to spend it on a variety of games such as a slot machine or race betting. The user can spend his desired amount on his machine. The user will eventually run out of money (similar to a regular casino) and will understand that gambling is not a good idea. Other features to learn about the dangers of irresponsible gambling will be added such as losing a game gives you a statistic on gambling.
