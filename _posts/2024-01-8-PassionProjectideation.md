## Casino Simulator

We want to begin with a login page, prompting the user to create an account with a username and password. Once the account is created, we move the user to the casino home page, where we give the user $100 in game currency and the user can choose to spend it on either the slot machine or race betting. The user can spend his desired amount on his machine. The user will eventually run out of money (similar to a regular casino) and will understand that gambling is not a good idea.
